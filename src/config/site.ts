        "With no prior game development experience, our capstone team created a fully 3D horror game based on our college.\n\nAs Junior Programmer and Graphics Lead, I handled character and environment modeling, rigging, animation, and UI/UX design. I also contributed to game logic, system design, and core mechanics development, and collaborated on the gameâ€™s webpage.\n\nThe game is a proprietary project of our college. To comply with the school's capstone publication policy, only a live demo is allowed.",
